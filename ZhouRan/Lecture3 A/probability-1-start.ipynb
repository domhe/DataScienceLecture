    "We talked about **frequentist** and **Bayesian** statistics, defined each, and took a first peek at **Bayes' Theorem**, a pillar of Data Science. **Probabilities** is all about *counting*: What's the number of alternate (quantum) universes that can exist? How many universes does Lews Hamilton win the F1 championship in? How many universes does Fernando Alonso win the F1 championship in? Computers are essentially counting machines. So we built a counting framework to let computers do the counting for us. Use it to have an idea which driver to place your bet on!\n",

Given these standings (please do not use team standings given on the same Web site, use driver standings), what is the Probability Distribution for each F1 driver to win the Russian Grand Prix? What is the Probability Distribution for each F1 driver to win *both* the Russian and Japanese Grand Prix? What is the probability for Ferrari to win both races?
