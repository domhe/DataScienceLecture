    "A Bayesian model is described by parameters and uncertainty in those parameters. The model is described as probability distributions, which we had time to experiment with. Uncertainly in its parameters is *also* described as probability distributions. That is why you need a solid foundation in probability theory.\n",

Oftentimes, even in the case of Big Data sometimes, there are conditions where **not enough data is available**, e.g. snowing with sun glare and white trucks. That is when accidents happen with autonomous vehicles!\n",

    "\n",
    "Let $Z$ be a random variable. Associated with $Z$ is a *probability distribution function* that assigns probabilities to the different outcomes $Z$ can take. Graphically, a probability distribution is a curve where the probability of an outcome on the x-axis is the value of the curve on the y-axis.\n",

    "\n",
    "-   **$Z$ is discrete**: Discrete random variables are *categorical*: They may only assume values on a specified list. In R, we call these values `factors`. Might as well call them `factors` in python. Movie ratings are an example of a discrete random variables. \n",

    "\n",
    "In probability theory, the *expectation*, or *expected value* of a random variable is what the frequentists would denote.. the long-run average value of repetitions of the experiment it represents. For example, the expected value in rolling a six-sided die is 3.5, because the average of all the numbers that come up in an extremely large number of rolls is close to 3.5 (why isn't it 3?).\n",

    "\n",
    "The mathematical definition of Expectation is the following: The expected value of a discrete random variable is the probability-weighted average of all possible values. In other words, each possible value the random variable can assume is multiplied by its probability of occurring, and the resulting products are summed to produce the expected value. So, for Formula 1 drivers, the Expectation of a Mercedes win is the sum of the probability of a Lewis Hamilton win and the probability of Sebastian Vetel win.\n",

    "The same principle applies to a continuous random variable, except that the **sum** is replaced with the **integral of the variable with respect to its probability density**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The expected value is a *key* aspect of how one characterizes a probability distribution; it is one type of *location* parameter. By contrast, the **variance**, another *key* value, is a measure of *dispersion* of the possible values of the random variable around the expected value. \n",

    "Let $X$ be a random variable with a finite number of finite outcomes $x_1,  x_2, ..., x_k$ occurring with probabilities  $p_1,  p_2, ...,  p_k$, respectively. The expectation of $X$ is defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$[X] = x_1 p_1  + x_2 p_2 + ... + x_k p_k$\n",

This is intuitive: the expected value of a random variable is the average of all values it can take; thus the expected value is what one expects to happen on average.\n",
    "\n",
    "The law of large numbers states that the arithmetic mean of the values almost surely converges to the expected value as the number of repetitions approaches infinity. The expected value is also known as the **expectation**, mathematical expectation, EV, average, mean value, mean, or **first moment**.\n",

It runs forward to compute consequences of assumptions it contains about the model, but also backward from the data to constrain possible explanations. In practice, many probabilistic programming systems will cleverly interleave forward and backward operations to efficiently home in on the best explanations.  - [Cronin, Beau. \"Why Probabilistic Programming Matters.\" 24 Mar 2013.

In my opinion, it's the most famous university lab associated to artificial neural networks and deep learning. It's pretty [well-funded](http://nouvelles.umontreal.ca/en/article/2017/09/15/facebook-invests-over-7m-u.s.-in-mila-and-ai-research-in-montreal/).\n",

    "For probabilistic programming, you write a program in Python that builds expressions for Theano. You still have to declare variables $a,b,c$ and give their types $(int, int, int)$, build expressions for how to put those variables together $a^b + c$, and compile expression graphs to functions $Pow(a,b,c)$ in order to use them for computation. What theano builds in return is a super-fast callable object from a purely symbolic graph, optimizes the graph, and even compiles some or all of it into native machine instructions.

    "\n",
    "Recall that Bayesian methodology returns a *distribution*. Hence we now have distributions to describe the unknown $\\lambda$s and $\\tau$. What have we gained? Immediately, we can see the uncertainty in our estimates: the wider the distribution (the more choice of $\\lambda$), the less certain our posterior belief should be. But we can also see what the plausible values for the parameters are: $\\lambda_1$ should be around 18 and $\\lambda_2$ around 23. The posterior distributions of the two $\\lambda$s are clearly distinct, indicating that it is *indeed likely* that there was a change in my girlfriend's text-message behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice also that the posterior distributions for the $\\lambda$s do not look like exponential distributions, even though our priors for these variables were exponential. In fact, the posterior distributions are not really of any form that we recognize from the original model. They look like normal distributions! It leads me to believe that I should have picked normal distributions for these priors. But if I do and get the same result, it;s ok! This is one of the benefits of taking a computational point of view. If we had instead done this analysis using mathematical approaches, we would have been stuck with an analytically intractable position. Our use of a computational approach makes us indifferent to mathematical tractability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our analysis also returned a distribution for $\\tau$. Its posterior distribution looks a little different from the other two because it is a *discrete* random variable, so it doesn't assign probabilities to intervals. We can see that near day 45, there is a close to 50% chance that my girlfriend's texting behaviour changed! Had no change occurred, or had the change been gradual over time, the posterior distribution of $\\tau$ would have been more spread out, reflecting that many days were plausible candidates for $\\tau$. By contrast, in the actual results we see that only three or four days make any sense as potential transition points. \n",
