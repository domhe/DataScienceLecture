Machine Learning experts have stronger stats foundation than CS undergraduates in a deep learning class. Information theory, in general, requires a strong understanding of data and probability (and linear algebra), and anyone interested in becoming a Data Scientist or Machine Learning Engineer needs to develop a deep intuition of statistical (and linear algebra) concepts. That is our journey in this class.\n",
