    "[Bayesian estimation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes_estimator) is practical and effective today thanks to [MCMC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo) algorithms implemented in popular libraries like `PyMC3`, `Sampyl`, `Stan`, and others. \n",

    "We won't look at the details of the algorithm itself today, but we'll look at the intuition behind it, and we'll introduce `Sampyl` as a simple library for probabilistic programming, simpler than `PyMc3` since some of you still have installation problems with the latter. Then, in our next notebook we'll graduate to the more advanced `PyMC3` library for probabilistic programming. \n",

    "> The blue M&M was introduced in 1995.  Before then, the color mix in a bag of plain M&Ms was (30% Brown, 20% Yellow, 20% Red, 10% Green, 10% Orange, 10% Tan).  Afterward it was (24% Blue , 20% Green, 16% Orange, 14% Yellow, 13% Red, 13% Brown). \n",
    "A friend of mine has two bags of M&Ms, and he tells me that one is from 1994 and one from 1996.  He won't tell me which is which, but he gives me one M&M from each bag.  One is yellow and one is green.  What is the probability that the yellow M&M came from the 1994 bag? Well, the old M&M bags' yellow count was higher, so it must be higher, right? But how to count?\n",

    "Before we see the colors of the M&Ms, there are two hypotheses, `A` and `B`, both with equal probability. These are our **prior** beliefs:\n",

    ">**VITERBI algorithm**: A famous algorithm with a lot of applications. For example, in speech-to-text (speech recognition), the acoustic signal is treated as the *observed* sequence of events, and a string of text is considered to be the *hidden cause* of the acoustic signal. The Viterbi algorithm finds the most likely string of text given the acoustic signal."

    ">Nicholas Metropolis authored the 1953 paper **Equation of State Calculations by Fast Computing Machines**, abridged [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_State_Calculations_by_Fast_Computing_Machines) and can be found [here](https://bayes.wustl.edu/Manual/EquationOfState.pdf), together with [Arianna W. Rosenbluth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arianna_W._Rosenbluth), [Marshall Rosenbluth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Rosenbluth), [Augusta H. Teller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusta_H._Teller) and [Edward Teller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Teller) (the father of the [Hydrogen bomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermonuclear_weapon)). This paper proposed the algorithm for the case of symmetrical proposal distributions, and [W. K. Hastings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._K._Hastings) extended it to the more general case in 1970.\n",

    ">Nicholas Metropolis had coined the term **Monte Carlo** to refer to [stochasticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic) (στοχαστικο, or *aiming at targets*) in an earlier paper with Stanislav Ulam, and led the group in the Theoretical Division that designed and built the [MANIAC I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MANIAC_I) computer used in the experiments in 1952. Edward Teller states in his memoirs that the five authors of the 1953 paper worked together for *days (and nights)*. According to [Roy Glauber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_J._Glauber) and [Emilio Segrè](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emilio_Segr%C3%A8) however, the original algorithm was invented by [Enrico Fermi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enrico_Fermi) and was reinvented by Stan Ulam.\n",

In this case too, we are bound to get different p-values.\n",

I call this the *Professor marry Rihanna exploration*. So a p-value does not reflect the probability of something happening in our universe. Rather, it reflects the probability that our universe is one amonst all that you visited in your voyages. That is slightly confusing to me..\n",

Just pick the ***model for the data*** and the ***model for each model parameter***, run the Metropolis algorithm, get the distribution of each parameter, deduce mean parameter values and parameter errors, and conclude\n",
