    "Around 1700, [Jacob Bernoulli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Bernoulli) wrote about removing colored balls from an urn in his landmark treatise *[Ars Conjectandi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ars_Conjectandi)*\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a three-part problem [adapted](http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/69151.html) from **mathforum.org**:\n",
    "\n",
    "> An urn contains 23 balls: 8 white, 6 blue, and 9 red.  We select six balls at random (each possible selection is equally likely). What is the probability of each of these possible outcomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "> 1. All balls are red\n",
    "2. 3 are blue, 2 are white, and 1 is red\n",
    "3. Exactly 4 balls are white\n",
    "\n",
    "So, outcome = set of 6 balls, sample space = set of all possible 6 ball combinations. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll mark our balls `'W1'` through `'W8'`, `'B1'` through `'B6'`, and `'R1'` through `'R9'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To note:\n",
    "- An outcome is a *set* of balls, where order doesn't matter, not a *sequence*, where order matters. When order **matters**, the set of outcomes is called all **permutations**. When order **does not matter**, the set of outcomes is called all **combinations**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of *combinations* of balls is the number of *permutations* divided by `c!`, where *c* is the number of balls. So there are less combinations and more permutations possible. If I want to choose 2 white balls from the 8 available, there are 8 ways to choose a first white ball and 7 ways to choose a second (because the first one has been picked and not available in the sample space anymore), and therefore 8 &times; 7 = 56 permutations of two white balls. But there are only 56 / 2 = 28 combinations, because `(W1, W2)` is the same combination as `(W2, W1)`.\n",
